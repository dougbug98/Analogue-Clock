# Analogue-Clock
An analogue clock created using HTML, CSS, &amp; Javascript
In my analog clock project, I created a Rolex-logoed clock that displayed the browser's time. JavaScript transformed the current time into degrees for the clock face. The circular clock face displayed the time with the Rolex emblem in the center. JavaScript updated the clock hands in real time. CSS was used to make the clock face, hands, and logo look professional. This project improved my JavaScript and CSS skills as we managed the DOM, Date object, and styled elements.
